# porflio-optimization-advanced-investment-science
This is the project done in the course Advanced Investment Science. Here I had made two portfolios for a hypothetical client who is teaching English in Korea to pay his college debt. He can do invest of $50K but of which $30K has to be paid as the loan. And from rest $20K, he wants to start a new business after going back to the US. He doesnâ€™t want to take very high risk on the $30K portion but he is okay to take risk in $20K if there is around 6% annual return. One of the portfolios done with Robust Portfolio optimization &amp; I applied algorithmic trading strategies in other. But it was giving less profit than just holding the asset. Therefore, I then decided to continue with holding the portfolio made by markowitz portfolio.
